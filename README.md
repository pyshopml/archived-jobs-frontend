### Installing Dependencies

You first need to install the dependencies. 

Run `npm install`. 

Npm will automatically install all dependencies.

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `public/` directory. Use the flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
